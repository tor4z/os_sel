# Carry flag is carry or borrow out of the Most Significant bit (MSb):

# CF (bit 0) Carry flag â€” Set if an arithmetic operation
# generates a carry or a borrow out of the mostsignificant
# bit of the result; cleared otherwise. This flag indicates
# an overflow condition for unsigned-integer arithmetic. It
# is also used in multiple-precision arithmetic.
